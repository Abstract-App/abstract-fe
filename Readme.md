## abstract:  a community for makers

One of the greatest tools a maker can have is a supportive community.  With this in mind, we set out to create a space for all types of creatives to share ideas and gain feedback from like-minded inviduals.  Unlike products like Behance and Dribbble, which focus on polished portfolios, abstract offers ways for makers to build and explore concepts from the ground up.
